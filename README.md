# BlogPost
BlogPost is a simple and intuitive blog application. All posts are loaded into the homepage, 10 at a time, and include sample content of the post. Users can switch through the pages to view additional posts. Viewing the post in it's entirety allows users to anonymously post comments. Users can also add new posts themselves. This is a React.js application front-end-only application. The server is simulated by the Typicode API where I pull all of the data used. This application was implemented with Redux, and redux-promise-middleware to allow for async calls in the action creators.

## Libraries (besides React)
- axios - A promise library used for ajax calls
- redux-promise-middleware - Allows for asyn action creators
- google-map-react - Loads a google maps UI component based on coordinates
