# BlogPost
This is a React.js blog application, with the front-end only. The server is simulated by the Typicode API where I pull all of the data used. This application was implemented with Redux, and redux-promise-middleware to allow for async calls in the action creators.

## Libraries (besides React)
- axios - A promise library used for ajax calls
- redux-promise-middleware - Allows for asyn action creators
- google-map-react - Loads a google maps UI component based on coordinates
